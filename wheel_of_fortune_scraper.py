#1.) Hard-coded dictionary of all user spin ID's and emails to track. Format of the dictionary is {Spin ID: email address}
tracked_spin_ids = {"MD3163259": "mattdimauro2@gmail.com"}

#2.) Email credentials for sending out the winning notification email. My email password is saved in my OS (using an app password from gmail for Python).
EMAIL_ADDRESS = "mattdimauro2@gmail.com"

if not EMAIL_PASSWORD:

#3.) CSV log file for historical winners
winning_historical_file = "winning_spin_id_log1.csv"

#4.) Scrape the winning spin id using requests and beautiful soup to parse the html.
def get_winning_spin_id():
    url = "http://www.wheeloffortunesolutions.com/spinid.html"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:   #will stop the process if the website is not reachable.

#5.) Send an email to the winner if there is one in our dictionary.

        print(f"Email has been successfully sent to {recipient}")

#6.) Log the winning spin ID and date to a CSV for historical tracking purposes.
def log_winning_spin_id(winning_spin_id):
    file_exists = os.path.isfile(winning_historical_file)

    with open(winning_historical_file, "a", newline="") as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        if not file_exists:
            writer.writerow(["Date", "Winning Spin ID"])

        writer.writerow([datetime.now().strftime("%m-%d-%Y"), log_entry])

#7.) Check the winning Spin ID and initiate the functions to log the winning id and send an email if there is a winner in our dictionary.
def check_spin_id():
    if datetime.today().weekday() >= 5:
        print("Skipping the check today as it is a weekend and there is no Wheel of Fortune tonight.")

    log_winning_spin_id(winning_spin_id)

    if winning_spin_id in tracked_spin_ids:
        send_winner_email(tracked_spin_ids[winning_spin_id], winning_spin_id)
    else:
        print("No tracked spin ID won today")

#8.) Schedule the script to run every weeknight at 10pm EST
schedule.every().monday.at("22:00").do(check_spin_id)
schedule.every().tuesday.at("22:00").do(check_spin_id)
schedule.every().wednesday.at("22:00").do(check_spin_id)
schedule.every().thursday.at("22:00").do(check_spin_id)

# Keep the script running
